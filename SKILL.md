# 3D-print modeling (Python-parametric, view-driven)

This is the workflow distilled from a series of FDM projects (worm-gear door drive, window
blind coupler, vortex shower head, tripod, turntable mount). The throughline: **geometry is
generated parametrically in Python, viewed in a browser, screenshotted headlessly, and
checked by eye on every change.** No GUI CAD (OpenSCAD/FreeCAD/Fusion) is needed, the geometry
engine is pip-installable Python: `build123d`/`CadQuery` (BREP) for new parts, `trimesh`+`manifold3d`
for meshes. See "Pick the engine first" below.

## The non-negotiable loop

1. **`build.py` is the single source of truth.** Put a `PARAMETERS` block at the top with
   every tunable + a one-line comment on *why* each value is what it is. Edit params, rerun,
   never hand-edit the mesh output.
2. **After every geometry change: rebuild, then LOOK at the render from multiple angles.**
   This is the non-negotiable verification step, not optional polish. Numeric and watertight
   checks miss the bugs that actually bite, wrong orientation, parts floating, collisions,
   holes not piercing, features distorted, a stretched-wrong axis. The drill:
   - `python3 serve.py` (once; port auto-derived per project, prints a LAN URL for the
     user's phone), then `python3 shoot.py <model>.glb chk` after each rebuild.
   - That writes **iso / front / side / top / BOTTOM + two section cuts** into **`.claude/renders/chk_*.png`**
     (the script always renders there, never the project root, so screenshots don't pollute the
     working dir). One angle is never enough, a part can look right head-on and be floating or
     colliding when seen from the side; the section cuts are how you confirm internal features
     (bores piercing, cavities connecting, wall thickness).
   - **Downscale, then actually Read every PNG**
     (`sips -Z 1400 .claude/renders/chk_iso.png --out .claude/renders/chk_iso_s.png`). Looking at
     the file path is not looking at the render. Read the image into the conversation and check it
     against what you intended.
   - Only then say done. If you couldn't render (no browser, no GLB), say so plainly instead of
     claiming the change works.
3. **Git checkpoint after each meaningful change.** These designs iterate fast and you want
   cheap reverts: `git add -A && git commit -m "<what changed>"`. Don't leave the tree dirty
   across iterations. (`git init` if the project isn't a repo yet.) Commit the source and the
   one current `web/assembly.glb`; gitignore renders and scratch iterations. See **Project layout**
   below for the exact commit-vs-ignore rule, it's the line the dual-axis-turntable got wrong
   (every `_t_*.glb`/`.3mf` iteration tracked at the repo root until it was unreadable).
4. **Keep a project `CLAUDE.md`** that records the mechanical intent, key numbers (and the
   tradeoff behind each), print orientation, and every hard-won gotcha. The next session reads
   it first. Update it as decisions land, don't wait for the end.
5. **Gate every export on the assembly audit + design invariants.** Watertight + pretty
   renders have repeatedly passed on assemblies that could not physically be assembled
   (lugs bigger than their notches, sealed "lids", freewheeling plain bores). Before any
   export: `python3 src/assembly_check.py web/assembly.glb` (pairwise interference +
   clearance + motion sweep, bundled) and `checks.py` design invariants (one assertion per
   user-approved feature, added the same turn it's approved, so features can't silently
   regress). Full protocol, insertion-path and torque-path audits included:
   **`references/assembly-verification.md`**.
6. **Never model a bought part from memory.** Datasheet, caliper, or user STL, then echo
   the dims back for confirmation before geometry depends on them. Guessed motors, boards,
   keypads, and battery holders have each cost a reprint. Measured library + checklist:
   **`references/components-verified.md`**.

## Project layout (set this up before modeling, not after)

Every multi-part project here converged on the same shape. **finnish-doors is the reference layout,
copy it.** Retrofitting organization onto a littered root (the dual-axis-turntable's actual state:
loose `_t_*.glb`, `bambu_*.3mf`, and STLs all at top level) is the tax you pay for skipping this.
The discipline: **all Python in `src/`, output routed into `stl/<subsystem>/`, the live assembly in
`web/`, a `Makefile` as the front door, and `requirements.txt` pinned.**

                        driver wiring, calibration constants). See dual-axis-turntable.
```

**`stlpaths.py` is the small piece that keeps the root clean.** Writers and readers both call
`stlp(name)`, which routes a bare filename to `stl/<subsystem>/name` by a prefix rule
(`worm_*`→drive, `housing_*`→housing). One rule, so the build, the assembly loader, and the Bambu
export stay in sync and nothing lands at the root. Bundled in `scripts/stlpaths.py`.

**The Makefile is the front door.** Targets seen across projects: `build` (rebuild all STLs +
`web/assembly.glb`), `export` (write Bambu plates), `viewer` (serve), `shot` (headless render),
`install`, `all`. End each target line with a trailing `## comment` so `make help` lists them.
A subsystem with its own script gets its own target (`make keypad` → `python3 src/build_rotary_keypad.py`).
Bundled in `scripts/Makefile`.

**Conditional builds via env vars, not commented-out code.** dual-axis-turntable drives one
`build.py` with `EXPORT=1` (write STLs, else just the GLB for the viewer), `SHELL=0`, `TILT=45`
(preview tilt clearance at 45°), `NOZZLE08=1`. Clean way to get preview/variant modes out of a
single source of truth without forking the file.

**When one assembly's `build.py` outgrows ~1.5k lines, split it into per-subsystem MODULES**
(desk-pi hit 3.4k lines, then split into `params.py` / `geo.py` (shared box/cyl/boolean/screw
helpers + COLORS) / one module per physical subsystem (`head.py`, `neck.py`, `chassis.py`,
`tracks.py`, ...) / `build.py` reduced to the entry that poses and collects parts into the GLB).
Keep the import DAG one-way and record it in CLAUDE.md: params ← geo ← part modules ← build,
params imports nothing local, no cycles. This is a different pattern from the standalone
`build_<sub>.py` scripts above: standalone scripts are for INDEPENDENT parts, modules are for
one interconnected assembly whose parts share params and interfaces.

**Publish `web/` to GitHub Pages when the user wants the viewer off-LAN** (phone anywhere,
sharing a link). It works because `web/` is self-contained and `assembly.glb` is committed:

Prefer the AUTO-DEPLOY wiring (desk-pi endgame): a workflow that publishes `web/` on any
push to main that touches it, with the repo's Pages source set to "GitHub Actions"
(`gh api -X PUT /repos/<r>/pages -F build_type=workflow`; no gh-pages branch at all):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pages.yml
on: {push: {branches: [main], paths: ["web/**"]}, workflow_dispatch: }
permissions: {contents: read, pages: write, id-token: write}
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: {name: github-pages, url: ${{ steps.d.outputs.page_url }}}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with: {path: web}
      - {id: d, uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4}
```

Then the flow is just build -> commit -> push. (The manual fallback, a `make pages` that
subtree-pushes `web/` to a gh-pages branch, works but every forgotten run ships a stale
viewer.) Add `web/.nojekyll` (empty) and a `web/index.html` meta-refresh redirect to the
viewer page. Note the commit that ADDS the workflow usually doesn't touch `web/`, so
trigger the first deploy by hand (`gh workflow run pages.yml`).

**What to commit vs ignore** (the line the turntable got wrong):
- **Commit:** `src/`, `stl/`, `web/assembly.glb` + `web/assembly_dims.json`, `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `Makefile`, `requirements.txt`. Committing the current `assembly.glb` means a fresh clone shows
  the part in the viewer with no rebuild, and you get a visual diff history.
- **Ignore:** `.claude/renders/`, scratch/iteration GLBs (`_t_*`, `_test_*`), `exports/*.3mf`
  (regenerable), videos (`*.mp4 *.mov *.avi`), `__pycache__/`. Minimum `.gitignore`:
  ```
  .claude/renders/
  _t_*
  _test_*
  exports/*.3mf
  *.mp4
  *.mov
  __pycache__/
  ```
  The anti-pattern: tracking every `_t_*.glb`/`.3mf` iteration at the repo root. It works, but the
  root becomes unreadable. Route outputs into `stl/` + `exports/` and ignore the scratch.

### Variants on the layout

- **Single quick part:** skip `src/`, just `build.py` + the bundled scripts at root. Graduate to the
  full layout the moment a second part appears.
- **Part-by-part** (user drives one part at a time: "now a bolt", "now a nut that fits it"):
  `build_all.py` at root discovers `parts/*.py` via importlib, each module defining `build() ->
  trimesh mesh`; shared helpers in `lib.py` (`save(mesh,name) -> stl/<name>.stl`, plus reusable
  generators like `threaded_rod(major_d,pitch,length)` feeding both the bolt and the nut). Keep
  `lib.py` + `build_all.py` at the ROOT (parts do `from lib import ...`; moving lib breaks that);
  scripts in `tools/` compute ROOT from `__file__` so they run from anywhere.
- **Foreign-CAD-centric** (you start from a downloaded STEP, not parametric source): `cad/` holds
  the STEP, `parts/<subassembly>/` holds pre-exported STLs grouped by subassembly with design
  iterations kept side by side (`Spool_V1/`, `Spool_V2/`), `tools/` holds the import/analysis
  scripts. This is the finnish-windows shape; see the **foreign-cad-import** skill for the gmsh
  tessellation + OCP hole/screw-BOM pipeline.

## Generating a parts KIT (multi-agent fan-out)

When the user wants MANY independent parts at once ("add connectors and function parts",
"a family of bolt variants"), and they've opted into multi-agent work, **fan out one subagent
per part, in parallel** (all Agent calls in one message). Measured on this project: 10 + 9 parts,
every one watertight on first build, ~44k tokens / ~1 min each. Rules that made it work:

- **Each agent creates ONLY its own `parts/<name>.py`** and verifies it
  (`python3 -c "from parts.<name> import build; m=build(); print(m.is_volume, ...)"`). It must NOT
  run `build_all.py`, touch `lib.py`, or edit other parts. Distinct new files = safe concurrent
  writes, no merge conflict. The orchestrator runs `build_all.py` ONCE after all agents return.
- **The speedup is SHARED HELPERS, not the agents.** Without them every agent re-derives the same
  geometry and re-types the same constants with *drifting names* (`INNER` vs `SLEEVE_IN` vs `43.0`),
  which also breaks single-source-of-truth (change the section once and 20 files silently disagree).
  So FIRST factor the common geometry + a constants block into `lib.py`
  (e.g. `SEC`, `SLEEVE_INNER`, `BORE`, `NUT_SQ` + `sleeve()`, `bolt_hole()`, `nut_pocket()`,
  `countersink()`), THEN **hand the helper API to each agent in its prompt** so they compose instead
  of invent. Drop a `parts/_template.py` (import line + helper cheat-sheet) to copy from.
- **Batch a tight family into ONE agent** when the members are variations of one parametric idea
  (corner/tee/cross = "N sleeves at a junction" → one `junction(dirs)` function), to avoid
  triplicated code. Reserve the strong model for hard geometry; trivial parts (caps, washers, plain
  blocks) are fine on a cheaper/faster model via the Agent `model` override.
- Give every agent the SAME system block (exact mm: section, clearances, thread spec) so parts
  actually interconnect; reference an existing canonical part ("copy the body of `parts/nut.py`").

## Viewer for a kit: categories + on-part labels

`parts_viewer.py` reads each part's one-line **docstring via `ast.get_docstring`** (no import) for a
description, groups the panel by a name→category map, and floats a CSS2D **name + short description
label above each part** (toggleable, like the dim labels). Keep the on-part description to the first
clause / ~44 chars single-line (full sentences wrap into tall overlapping columns); put the full
text in the side panel.

**Threaded meshes are HEAVY.** An M30 `threaded_rod` at `n_theta=96, steps_per_pitch=12` is ~99k
faces; a dozen threaded parts base64-embedded blew the self-contained viewer to 31 MB. Drop the
thread resolution (64/6 → 13 MB, still fine for both viewer and a utility-bolt print). Quadric
decimation (`simplify_quadric_decimation`) may be unavailable on system Python 3.9 (a `type | None`
type-union bug), so lowering generation resolution beats decimating after.

## Pick the engine first: BREP (build123d/CadQuery) vs mesh (trimesh)

These projects historically built everything in **trimesh** because "OpenSCAD/FreeCAD aren't
installed." That reasoning is stale, and it's worth correcting before you start a new part:

- **For NEW parametric parts, prefer a real BREP kernel: `build123d` (or `CadQuery`).** Both are
  `pip install` (they ship their own OpenCascade via the `cadquery-ocp` wheel, so NO system CAD
  install and no macOS Gatekeeper problem, which was the original blocker). They give you true
  solids with native fillets, chamfers, lofts, sweeps, and threads, and they **import AND export
  STEP** plus STL/3MF. `bd_warehouse` adds parametric gears/threads/fasteners to build123d, so you
  don't hand-roll involute math. This is far more productive than reconstructing geometry from
  triangle arrays. Caveat: needs **Python ≥3.10** (the system `python3` here is 3.9, use a newer
  interpreter or a venv). build123d and CadQuery share the OCP wrapper, so objects interchange.
- **Use trimesh + manifold3d when the input IS a mesh** (downloaded STL/3MF, mesh surgery on a part
  with no parametric source), or as the robust boolean engine on triangle soups. It's battle-tested
  and exports a named GLB straight to the viewer. It does NOT read STEP (see foreign-cad-import).
- **They compose:** model the part in build123d, export STL, then use the trimesh viewer/`shoot.py`
  loop and the FDM checks below. The view-screenshot-iterate loop is identical regardless of engine.

The rest of this skill's report/verify/print guidance is engine-agnostic. The notes below describe
the trimesh path (what these projects used); the same checks apply to build123d output.

## Toolchain (all via `pip3 install --user`, or a venv for build123d)

- **trimesh 4.12 + manifold3d**, boolean CSG (`engine="manifold"`): holes, pockets, bores,
  keyed profiles, housings. manifold3d is still the recommended robust, guaranteed-manifold CSG
  backend for Python meshes. **All boolean inputs must be watertight volumes** or manifold throws
  "Not all meshes are volumes!", check `mesh.is_volume` per part when a union/difference fails.
  **Pin the pair** (`trimesh`+`manifold3d`) together, a major manifold3d bump has broken
  `trimesh.boolean` before; upgrade them in lockstep, not piecemeal.
- **numpy**, vertex/tooth math. **shapely**, 2D profiles, then `extrude_polygon` / `revolve`
  to 3D (gear teeth, threads, revolved chambers). **scipy / networkx / rtree**, as needed for
  sections and multi-loop work.
- **trimesh exports GLB directly** with named, vertex-colored nodes, no 3MFLoader needed in
  the browser. Gear/worm tooth profiles are computed from first principles (involute wheel,
  trapezoidal thread), then fed to trimesh; CSG only does holes and housings.
- **playwright + Chromium**, headless viewer screenshots (swiftshader GL, no real GPU needed).

In the trimesh path you generate tooth/thread profiles from first principles and reach for CSG
(manifold) only for holes, pockets, and housing booleans. In build123d, prefer `bd_warehouse` for
gears/threads instead of hand-rolling them. Either way: a helical *bore* through a straight shaft
must be cut **straight**, not helical, or the shaft won't pass.

## Bundled scripts (copy into the project, they're generic)

Everything in `scripts/` is project-agnostic. Copy what you need:

- **`serve.py`**, tiny static server (browsers won't fetch `.glb`/`.stl` over `file://`).
  `python3 serve.py` with no args derives a **stable per-project port** (8100-8799 from the
  project dir name), so two projects can never collide on 8765 again (that collision burned
  three projects debugging the wrong model). Binds 0.0.0.0 and prints the **LAN URL so the
  user can open the viewer on a phone on the same wifi**. Answers `/__project__` so shoot.py
  can verify identity. Sets `Cache-Control: no-store` and the `.glb` mime type.
- **`assembly_check.py`**, the pre-export gate: pairwise boolean interference (exit 1 on
  un-whitelisted overlap, Makefile-gateable), sub-clearance warnings, and a `--sweep`
  motion check across a moving part's full travel. See `references/assembly-verification.md`.
- **`wallcheck.py`**, fast trustworthy wall-thickness + breach checking (shell
  self-thickness via voxel EDT; parts-inside-shell breach via union -> signed distance,
  coarse proxy for search, exact for the verdict). The naive alternatives (contains-probes
  at seams, KDTree signs) false-alarm; this encodes the recipe that finally worked.
- **`checks_template.py`**, design-invariant tests ("unit tests for geometry"): copy to
  `src/checks.py`, add one check per user-approved requirement the same turn it's approved,
  run at the end of every build. Kills the silently-deleted-feature class.
- **`viewer_glb.html`**, the main Three.js (0.169, jsdelivr) GLB viewer for **multi-part
  assemblies**, and the single viewer that carries every feature the projects evolved. `?m=<file>.glb`.
  Responsive: side panel on desktop/big displays (font scales with viewport), collapsible
  ☰ bottom sheet with fat touch targets on phones; canvas is `touch-action:none` so
  one-finger orbit / two-finger pan-zoom don't fight page gestures.
  Per-part toggles **grouped BY OBJECT into collapsible categories** (name-regex `CATS` table,
  each group with a toggle-all checkbox, indeterminate when mixed -- how you flip the pieces of
  one split object on and off), deterministic per-name colors, **ghost-outline**
  default for housing-like parts (translucent + edge lines) with a **solid** toggle,
  **click-to-select** (raycast on click; >6 px pointer travel = orbit, not click: the part glows,
  its row highlights + scrolls into view, name + posed world L/W/H print under the title; same
  part / empty space / Esc clears), **per-part
  L/W/H axis dimension lines + labels** (toggleable;
  X=length red, Y=width green, Z=height blue), an **explode** slider (parts fly out radially,
  composed with the joint pose in ONE place), **per-joint pose sliders** from the
  `<model>.pose.json` sidecar (rotary AND linear joints -- see the articulated-assemblies
  section), the **fit map ON by default** (patches re-posed per kinematic group), a
  **section cut on any axis** (X/Y/Z select + slider), a **spin** toggle, a print-bed grid, Z-up,
  ACES tone mapping, and auto-reload on rebuild. Exposes `window._scene/_cam/_controls/THREE` and
  sets `window.__ready` for headless control by `shoot.py`. The dimension labels use `CSS2DRenderer`
  so they always face the camera and follow their part through explode.
- **`viewer_stl.html`**, simpler single-STL viewer for mesh-surgery work. `?file=<f>.stl&view=iso`,
  print-bed grid, axes, bbox HUD.
- **`parts_viewer.py`**, bundles every STL in a dir into ONE self-contained `parts_viewer.html`
  (base64-embedded, **no server, double-click to open**). Multi-part grid / "in place" layout,
  per-part show/hide, CAD-style **L/W/H dimension lines** on each bbox, spin/fit, and an OPTIONAL
  data-driven **assembly view** (drop an `assembly.json` of 4x4 poses next to the STLs). This is the
  viewer for the **part-by-part workflow** (many independent STLs you iterate on and want to see
  together + dimensioned); `viewer_glb.html` is for a single live-reloading assembly GLB instead.
- **`shoot.py`**, headless multi-angle renders via Playwright. `python3 shoot.py model.glb tag
  [port]` writes `.claude/renders/tag_{iso,front,side,top,bottom,sec_mid,sec_iso}.png` (always
  into `.claude/renders/`, created on demand, so renders never clutter the project root).
  **Bottom is in the standard set**: bed-facing bugs (floating discs, raised features that
  should be engraved) hide from every other angle. Defaults to the same per-project port as
  serve.py and **aborts if `/__project__` says the server belongs to another project**.
  Auto-detects STL vs GLB by extension. Pairs with `serve.py`.
- **`stlpaths.py`**, the subsystem router from **Project layout**. `stlp("worm.stl")` →
  `stl/drive/worm.stl` by filename prefix; `webpath()` / `exportpath()` / `rootpath()` for the
  other dirs. Drop it in `src/`, edit the `SUBSYSTEMS` prefix table per project. Keeps every export
  out of the repo root and the assembly loader + Bambu export reading the same paths the build wrote.
- **`Makefile`**, the front door (`make build / export / viewer / shot / install / all`),
  self-documenting via trailing `## ` comments (`make help` lists them). Add one target per extra
  `build_<sub>.py`.
- **`requirements.txt`**, the pinned toolchain (`trimesh>=4.12` + `manifold3d>=2.5` as a pair,
  numpy/scipy/shapely/networkx/rtree/matplotlib/playwright). `make install` runs it + `playwright
  install chromium`.

**Image cap:** renders are @2x and phone/Retina-scale captures exceed the 2000px many-image
limit, which poisons the whole session. Always downscale before reading a PNG inline:
`sips -Z 1400 .claude/renders/in.png --out .claude/renders/in_s.png` (or `-Z 1100` for the
densest scenes).

**Don't reopen the user's browser tab.** The viewer auto-reloads `assembly.glb` on rebuild
(polls Last-Modified), the user watches changes land live. `shoot.py` is a separate headless
context for *your* verification.

**Viewer gotchas baked into the templates** (carried from real breakage):
- Three.js `3MFLoader` ignores Bambu's multi-file production extension → bake to GLB instead.
- trimesh writes colors as *vertex* colors, so `material.color` is unreliable, classify parts
  by **mesh name**, not color.
- GLB normals often arrive inverted/unlit → `computeVertexNormals()` + `DoubleSide`.
- Without ACES tone mapping, raw light intensities clip to white.
- `top`/`bottom` camera views are degenerate (camera-up parallel to view dir) → on-screen axis
  orientation is arbitrary; trust `iso`/`front`/`side` for axes.
- `matplotlib` 3D (`Poly3DCollection`) has no occlusion → muddy and misleading. Use the Three.js
  viewer for anything you actually need to read.
- **Z-up the right way: `cam.up=(0,0,1)`, a `GridHelper` with `rotation.x=PI/2`, sit parts on the
  ground via `mesh.position.z = -bbox.min.z`, spin about Z.** Do NOT rotate the geometry to Three's
  default Y-up to fake it, it fights OrbitControls and renders cylinders / bores lying on their side.
- **The headless browser caches `localhost:<port>/<file>` per port.** A stale `serve.py` from a
  prior project on the same port silently serves the WRONG model (you debug geometry that's fine).
  The bundled serve.py/shoot.py now auto-derive a per-project port and handshake via
  `/__project__`; if you override the port manually, keep it unique per project and
  `pkill -f serve.py` whenever a render looks like someone else's part.
- **CSS2D dimension labels:** `CSS2DRenderer` + a second `.render(scene,cam)` in the loop gives crisp
  bbox L/W/H tags that always face the camera; attach them as children of the mesh so they follow it.

## Articulated assemblies: pose sidecar + viewer joint sliders

When the assembly has joints (pan/tilt head, hinged lid, rotating stage), don't rebuild the GLB
to inspect another pose. The pattern that landed on desk-pi (reference implementation:
its `web/viewer_glb.html` + the sidecar writer in `src/build.py`):

- **The build writes a `<model>.pose.json` sidecar next to the GLB** on every run: the BAKED
  preview pose angles (the GLB's vertices bake whatever pose the build rendered), each joint's
  axis position, the travel limits, and a name → kinematic-group map (which nodes ride which
  joint: `head` rides tilt rides pan, `pan` rides pan only, everything else fixed).
- **The viewer adds one slider per joint and applies DELTA rotations** from the baked angles
  (slider pose × inverse of baked pose), per kinematic group, composed with explode in ONE
  place so the two effects don't fight over `object.position`. The user drags pan/tilt live;
  no rebuild.
- **Fit-map patches are stored in NEUTRAL-pose coords**, so unlike the baked meshes they need
  the FULL slider pose, not the delta. A patch belongs to the MORE moving of its two parts
  (child group > parent group > fixed); same-group pairs then ride exactly.
- **Linear joints ride the same sidecar** (desk-pi's telescoping antenna masts): list the
  moving nodes (`ant_nodes`) + travel + the baked extension; the viewer composes a
  head-local translation INSIDE the parent joint pose
  (`parentPose . T(0,0,slider-baked) . inv(bakedParentPose)`), one slider per node, so a
  tilted head deploys along its own up. Bake the preview extension via env
  (`ANT=<mm> make build`) like the rotary poses.
- **Shoot the extremes, not just neutral.** Drive the bake pose via env (`PAN=90 TILT=-30
  make build && make shot`) and read those renders too; the neutral render hides every swept
  collision. For the numeric version see the motion sweep + swept-envelope notes in
  `references/assembly-verification.md`.
- **Place new mechanisms by PROBING keep-outs, not by eyeballing:** transform the moving
  group's vertices into the target frame across the joint range and take the cloud's
  bounds (desk-pi: the tilt drivetrain sweeps x +-24 z<174 inside the head; the screen
  tray owns x 56..68 z<196) -- then lay the new gear train inside the free bands and let
  the interference gate arbitrate. Guessing placements cost three collision rounds;
  probing found the only workable band in one.

## Verify before "done"

- **Run the assembly gate**: `assembly_check.py` (pairwise interference, clearance,
  motion sweep) + `fitmap.py` (pairwise CLEARANCE MEASUREMENT + contact patches — booleans
  prove non-overlap, not non-press; a gearbox passed every boolean while seized at 0.00°
  backlash; run the canonical report at the NEUTRAL pose, and since a full-assembly pass
  costs minutes keep it a flag like `FITS=1` / `make fits`, not part of the fast watch
  loop) + `checks.py` design invariants + the insertion-path and torque-path
  audits from `references/assembly-verification.md`. "Watertight and looks right from six
  angles" has shipped unassemblable parts to plastic more than once; the gate is what
  catches lugs bigger than notches, sealed pockets, and freewheeling bores.
- `mesh.is_watertight` and `mesh.is_winding_consistent` after every edit.
- Print a feature-size report: smallest wall / tooth tip / thread crest. **< ~0.6 mm won't print**
  (the slicer's Arachne generator smooths it away).
- For "does this hole actually pierce / does this cavity connect" use `mesh.contains()` probes
  along the **real feature axis**, a naive horizontal/planar sample misses slanted or staggered
  holes and falsely reports "no hole."
- **Then render from multiple angles and read every PNG (the iso/front/side/top + section cuts
  from `shoot.py`).** This is the step that catches what the numbers can't: watertight + correct
  measurements still hides orientation, collision, floating-part, and feature-distortion bugs.
  Treat "I looked at all the angles and they match intent" as the bar for done, not "it's watertight."

## Splitting big prints for speed (and less support)

When a part dominates print time or needs a big bed, split it and join with printed
features (desk-pi took its four biggest from a 434 cm3 worst-piece / 256 bed to a
225 cm3 worst-piece with everything on 180x180, and no plate over 8 h):

- **Halve wide shells at a plane through their sparse cross-section** (a head shell's
  only solid at x=0 was the top wall + one rear strip). Joint kit per seam: an internal
  flange with 2x M3 (clearance + counterbore one side, Ø2.5 thread-form pilot the
  other), Ø4 dowels for shear/alignment, or a 0.15-fit tongue/groove where a flange
  won't fit. **Stagger the seams of nested parts** (bezel at x=+22 vs back at x=0) so
  the assembled stack interlocks like brickwork, and count the OTHER parts that bridge
  a seam (perimeter screws, rails, pinned trim) before adding more joint hardware.
- **Kill ceiling support with a panel/frame split, not more supports:** a tub-shaped
  part printed open-face-down turns its whole back wall into a supported ceiling.
  Split the flat wall off as a PANEL (prints lying flat, features up, ~zero support,
  minutes not hours) and leave a wall FRAME that prints with no ceiling at all; join
  with M3s from the back into frame rim tabs (clip tabs into rounded-corner mass with
  `inter(tab, solid)` -- at the wall plane the "side wall" may be all corner curve).
- **Slabs with a precision feature keep it monolithic:** a deck carrying a bearing
  seat splits into strips AROUND the seat (half-laps + vertical screws), never through
  it.
- **Solid styling bodies get pockets, not seams** (a display pod's solid tiers:
  interior lightening pockets with >=2 mm walls).
- **Gates must survive the rename:** alias each piece to its parent object for
  whitelist lookups and allow same-parent contact (the designed seam) -- the
  `SPLIT_ALIAS` hook in the bundled `assembly_check.py` / `fitmap.py`. Then re-run the
  full gate stack and re-plate the slicer export (the part list changed; a stale
  exporter re-plating deleted names is the staleness class the bambu skill warns about).
- **Measure, don't guess, the win:** headless-slice the re-plated project and quote
  per-plate times (foreign-cad-import skill, BambuStudio CLI; pass `--export-3mf` a
  RELATIVE filename -- it prepends `--outputdir` even to absolute paths).
